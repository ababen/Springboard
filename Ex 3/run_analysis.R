#1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

#2. Extracts columns containing mean and standard deviation for each measurement (Hint: Since some feature/column names are repeated, you may need to use the make.names() function in R)

#3. Creates variables called ActivityLabel and ActivityName that label all observations with the corresponding activity labels and names respectively

#4. From the data set in step 3, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
